# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Dashboard

An interactive **Machine Learning Dashboard** built using **Streamlit** that predicts a passenger’s survival probability on the Titanic based on key features such as age, gender, class, and fare.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
- Built and compared **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models
- Achieved ROC-AUC of **0.88+** for both models
- Designed a **Streamlit dashboard** to take live user input and visualize:
  - ✅ Predicted survival result
  - 📊 Survival probability bar
  - 🧩 Feature importance analysis

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for interactive UI)
- **Scikit-learn** (for model building)
- **Matplotlib** (for charts)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data preprocessing)

---
